### Navigate the Codebase

![Folders](/assets/img/setup/_code1.png)

The `src` folder is where the code is. The `pages` folder is where the pages are, and `index.astro` is the home page. In this example, the page is made up of **components** called `Hero` and `Products`. Those are located in the `components` folder.

#### Changing Text

Open `src/components/landing/Hero.astro`. Find the title text and change it to have whatever. <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to save and see your changes in the preview whenever you make a change.

#### Changing Images

Open `src/components/landing/Products.astro`. Find an `<img>` tag and change the `src=` to have a different image link.

#### Styling

All style in the project is done with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="font-semibold text-blue-500" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>. Check out that site for examples on fonts, colors, etc.

**_Example ChatGPT Prompt_**

You can use ChatGPT to spit out Tailwind style with HTML content.

**prompt**

```
"Welcome to my website" centered text blue using tailwind.
```

**output**

```html
<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen">
  <h1 class="text-blue-500 text-center text-4xl">Welcome to my website</h1>
</div>
```

### Save Project and Deploy (Push)

To save the project in StackBlitz and have it deploy to Vercel, select the **Commit** button in the top left, put a save message to identify your changes, and then **Commit and Push**.

In Vercel, navigate to the project (whatever `company-name` is for you) and find the **Deployments** tab. You can see the most recent deployments and commit messages.
